# Convert into the RegretNet-nm

convert into the 2d space implement

## TODO

- [done]run with inital implement 
- [pick]find the regret net data
- comment the regret net module
- generate our 2d daya

## raw code explaination

first get the totally full with the code and the 

Dependencies are Python 3, a recent PyTorch, numpy/scipy, tqdm, future and tensorboard.

Plotting with Matplotlib.

Implementation of the neural network is in the module `regretnet`. 

To train and test auction networks, use the scripts `train.py` and `test.py`; `sample_scripts.sh` gives some examples of how to invoke these.

Pretrained models are in the `model` directory.
